# K-R-Solutions
Solutions to The C Programming Language by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.

This repository contains my own solutions to the exercises given in the book
'The C programming Language' by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, specifically,
the second edition, otherwise referred to as simply 'K&R2'. It should be mentioned,
that C was itself created by one of the co-authors of this book, Dennis Ritchie
during his time at Bell Labs. Brian Kernighan, also a Bell Labs employee, wrote much
of expository content of this book.

All code has been written entirely myself without any external help other than the book itself.
It is for this reason that there is no guarantee that the solutions are entirely
complete and devoid of any possible errors and/or bugs. However, in saying this
I have tried my best to write the simplest and most elegant code within my abilities,
while testing the programs myself to a level I believe to be satisfactory.

In order to keep up to date with modern standards, I have written code in
accordance with C99.

In terms of style I have chosen to abide by Google's C++ standard.

All code has been written using VIM, specifically version 8.2.2121. All code has been compiled
using gcc with no flags given.
